## Day 2: Networking Fundamentals & Tracking

**Focus:** IP Addresses, DNS, and Ports

During a simulated investigation of suspicious logins, I realized the critical importance of IP addresses in tracing activity.

**What I Learned:**
- **IP Addressing:** Differences between IPv4 and IPv6; distinction between Private and Public IP ranges.
- **DNS Architecture:** How domain names are structured and resolved to IPs.
- **Communication:** The role of Ports and Protocols in identifying services.

**Relevance:**
This knowledge is essential for:
1. Tracing attackers through digital footprints.
2. Identifying active services on a target during reconnaissance.
3. Understanding the flow of communication across the internet.
