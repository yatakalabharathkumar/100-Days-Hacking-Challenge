## 🗓️ Day 23/100 – Introduction to Mutillidae

**Focus:** Setting up and exploring the OWASP Mutillidae II lab environment.

### 🕷️ What is Mutillidae?
Mutillidae is a deliberately vulnerable web application that implements the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. It provides a realistic environment for practicing web application security.

### ⚔️ Key Activities
1.  **Lab Integration:** Successfully accessed Mutillidae (typically hosted on a local server or VM like Metasploitable).
2.  **Reconnaissance:** Explored the application structure to identify potential attack surfaces (forms, URL parameters, login pages).
3.  **Attack Simulation:**
    *   Simulated real-world attacks commonly found in poorly maintained websites.
    *   Tested basic injection vectors to observe application behavior.

### 🧠 Learning Outcome
Mutillidae is excellent for understanding **legacy vulnerabilities**. It highlights how "technical debt" and poor maintenance creating lasting security risks in production environments. It serves as a comprehensive practice ground for manual exploitation techniques.
