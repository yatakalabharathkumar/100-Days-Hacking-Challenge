## Day 8: Submarine Cables & Physical Infrastructure

**Focus:** Network Infrastructure, Physical Security, and Global Data Flow

I explored the physical layer of the internet, specifically Submarine Cables, which carry 99% of global traffic.

**Key Learnings:**
- **The "Cloud" is Physical:** Data travels via fiber-optic cables under oceans, not satellites.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - *Physical:* Damage from anchors, sharks, or sabotage.
  - *Cyber:* Tapping into "Landing Stations" to intercept data streams.
- **Strategic Importance:** How disrupting a few cables can isolate entire nations (Availability attacks).
- **Defense:** The need for route diversity and encryption at the physical layer.

**Realization:** A firewall cannot protect data if the physical cable carrying it is cut or tapped.
