# Day 25 – OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities  
## 100 Days of Ethical Hacking

## 📌 Overview
On **Day 25**, I studied the **OWASP Top 10**, which represents the most critical web application security risks responsible for real-world data breaches.  
This list is widely used by developers, penetration testers, and security teams as a baseline for application security.

## 🔐 What is OWASP Top 10?
The **OWASP Top 10** is a globally recognized awareness document that highlights the most common and dangerous vulnerabilities found in web applications.

Understanding these risks helps in:
- Preventing data breaches
- Improving secure coding practices
- Strengthening application security posture

## 🚨 OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

1. **Broken Access Control**  
   Unauthorized users can access restricted resources or perform privileged actions.

2. **Cryptographic Failures**  
   Sensitive data exposure due to weak or improper encryption.

3. **Injection**  
   Attacker-controlled input is interpreted as commands (SQL, OS, LDAP).

4. **Insecure Design**  
   Lack of security controls at the architecture and design level.

5. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   Default settings, open services, or verbose error messages.

6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**  
   Using libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**  
   Weak login, session handling, or credential management.

8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**  
   Untrusted updates, CI/CD pipeline issues, or insecure deserialization.

9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**  
   Attacks go undetected due to missing or ineffective logging.

10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**  
    Server fetches attacker-controlled URLs, exposing internal systems.

## 💥 Why OWASP Top 10 Causes Data Breaches
- Most vulnerabilities are **easy to exploit**
- Often overlooked during development
- Present in production for long periods
- Attackers actively scan for these weaknesses

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- OWASP Top 10 is a **must-know foundation** for application security
- Secure design is as important as secure coding
- Regular testing and updates reduce risk significantly
