## 100 Days Hacking Challenge – Day 1

On Day 1 of my **100 Days Hacking Challenge**, my perspective on hacking changed completely.

I realised that real hackers start with **white‑hat fundamentals**, not random attacks or tool-hopping.

**What I learned on Day 1:**
- The true meaning of **bug bounty hunting**
- How **penetration testing** is different from unstructured/random attacks
- How **computer networking** works behind the scenes
- The basics of **client–server architecture**
- How **data packets** travel across networks
- The different roles and types of **servers**

This is the kind of foundation real cybercrime investigators and security professionals rely on *before* touching any tool.

I will be logging my daily progress here as part of the 100 Days Hacking Challenge.
