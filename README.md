**Day 6 of #100DaysHackingChallenge 🕰️🔍**

The Case: A scammer cheated victims and then deleted his website to hide the evidence. He thought he was safe.

The Solution: Today, I used the Wayback Machine (Internet Archive). It’s basically a time machine for the web.

What I recovered:
📂 The original homepage (before deletion).
💸 The fake "investment" offers.
📞 Hidden contact details.

Lesson: Deleting a website does NOT erase its history. Digital footprints are permanent. The internet never forgets. 👁️

Have you ever used the Wayback Machine? 👇
