## Day 9: Cable Vulnerabilities & Geopolitics

**Focus:** Availability Attacks, Physical Sabotage, and Critical Infrastructure Risk

I investigated how vulnerable the global internet is to physical disruption of submarine cables.

**Key Learnings:**
- **Chokepoints:** Geographic bottlenecks (e.g., Red Sea, Suez Canal) where many cables converge, creating high risk.
- **Threat Vectors:**
  - *Accidental:* Anchor dragging, fishing trawlers (most common).
  - *Intentional:* State-sponsored sabotage during geopolitical tension.
- **Impact:**
  - *Economic:* Disruption of SWIFT/Banking networks.
  - *Social:* Internet blackouts affecting communication and emergency services.
- **Case Studies:** Reviewed the 2024 East Africa outages and Red Sea cable cuts.

**Realization:** "Availability" (the 'A' in the CIA Triad) is heavily dependent on the physical security of these cables.
