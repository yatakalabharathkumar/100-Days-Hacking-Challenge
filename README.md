## Day 10: Proxies & VPNs

**Focus:** Anonymization, Privacy, and Tool Duality

I learned how Proxies and VPNs work, and more importantly, how they serve different purposes for different users.

**Key Learnings:**

### Proxies
- **Definition:** An intermediary server that forwards client requests and masks the originating IP.
- **Types:** Forward Proxy, Reverse Proxy, Transparent Proxy.
- **Attacker Use:** Hide identity during reconnaissance or exploitation.
- **Defender Use:** Filter outbound traffic and monitor suspicious activity.

### VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
- **Encryption:** All traffic is encrypted end-to-end.
- **Attacker Use:** Maintain anonymity while conducting attacks or exfiltrating data.
- **Defender Use:** Protect personal privacy from ISP snooping and public WiFi threats.

**Important Realization:** 
The same tool is not inherently "good" or "bad"—it depends on intent and authorization.

**Lesson:** Understanding both offensive and defensive applications is crucial for a well-rounded cybersecurity professional.
