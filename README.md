## Day 3: OSINT & WHOIS Analysis

**Focus:** Domain Investigation, WHOIS Protocol, and Scam Detection

I investigated a fraudulent crypto investment site to understand how attackers set up their infrastructure.

**What I Learned:**
- **WHOIS Lookup:** How to query domain registrars for ownership and registration data.
- **Evidence Gathering:** Using creation dates to disprove claims of "long-standing reputation."
- **Link Analysis:** How registrant details can connect multiple scam websites to a single actor.
- **OSINT Basics:** The role of public records in identifying malicious networks.

**Tool Used:** `whois` (Command Line / Web Tools)
