## Day 6: OSINT & Web Archiving

**Focus:** Digital Forensics, Internet History, and Evidence Preservation

I investigated a "deleted" scam website to understand how digital footprints persist.

**What I Learned:**
- **Wayback Machine:** How to query the Internet Archive to find historical versions of a URL.
- **Evidence Recovery:** Retrieving content (text, images, contact info) from a site that is currently offline (404).
- **Persistence:** Understanding that automated bots crawl and archive the web constantly, making total deletion difficult for attackers.
- **Forensic Value:** How snapshots serve as proof of past intent and activity.

**Tools Used:** `archive.org` (Wayback Machine), `cachedview`
