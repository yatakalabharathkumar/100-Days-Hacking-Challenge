## Day 7: Building a Hacking Lab

**Focus:** Virtualization, Legal Compliance, and Safe Testing Environments

I learned how to set up a legal and safe environment for practicing penetration testing.

**Key Learnings:**
- **Virtualization:** Using hypervisors (VirtualBox/VMware) to run isolated virtual machines (VMs).
- **Lab Components:**
  - *Attacker Machine:* Kali Linux / Parrot OS.
  - *Target Machine:* Metasploitable, DVWA, or OWASP Juice Shop.
- **Safety:** Importance of network isolation (Host-Only/NAT Network) to prevent accidental scanning of external networks.
- **Ethics:** Understanding that hacking is only legal when performed on infrastructure you own or have explicit permission to test.

**Why it matters:** This "sandbox" approach allows for aggressive testing without legal risk or damage to real-world systems.
